                <h2>Business Problem Statement and Significance:</h2>
                <p>In the healthcare sector, particularly in hospital management, patient satisfaction is not only a critical indicator of quality but increasingly a determinant of hospital reimbursements under value-based payment models. As healthcare funding shifts towards these models, where payments are tied to the quality of care rather than the quantity, Mount Sinai Hospital faces a crucial challenge. Recent reviews have highlighted variability in patient satisfaction across different service areas. It is imperative that we understand these variations and address them proactively to improve care delivery. Enhancing patient satisfaction directly influences our financial health under value-based payment frameworks, where higher satisfaction scores can lead to better reimbursement rates and financial incentives. This necessitates a comprehensive analytical tool to monitor, analyze, and act on various aspects of patient satisfaction in real time.</p>
                
                <h2>Objective:</h2>
                <p>The objective of this dashboard is to provide a clear, concise, and interactive visualization of HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) patient satisfaction scores across various metrics. It should help us identify strengths and areas for improvement, facilitate benchmarking with peer institutions, and track the effectiveness of any interventions we implement.</p>
                
                <h2>Specific Aims:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Visibility and Insight:</strong> Develop a dashboard that provides immediate visibility into Mount Sinai’s patient satisfaction metrics, highlighting internal strengths and areas needing improvement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Benchmarking and Comparative Analysis:</strong> Enable comparative analysis with peer hospitals to contextualize Mount Sinai’s performance within the regional and national healthcare landscape, helping identify best practices and set realistic performance goals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Variance Analysis:</strong> Implement variance analysis features to compare Mount Sinai's scores against cohort, state, and national averages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Actionable Recommendations:</strong> Based on data from the dashboard, we should be able to derive actionable insights that can be implemented to improve patient care and satisfaction. This might include staff training, operational changes, or enhanced patient-care protocols.</li>
                </ul>
